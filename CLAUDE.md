# CLAUDE.md — `balance`

Project-specific context for Claude Code. Read this together with the global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and `PRD.md`.

## What this is

A **single-user REST API** for personal financial records: incomings, expenses, savings vaults, and balance business logic. Full CRUD with soft deletion. POC stage. See `PRD.md` for requirements/decisions and `ARCHITECTURE.md` for diagrams and the file map.

## Tech stack

- **Runtime:** Node.js (CommonJS).
- **Framework:** Express.
- **Database:** SQLite via `better-sqlite3` (synchronous, single-file).
- **Config:** `dotenv` with per-environment files (`stage`, `prod`).
- **No** TypeScript, ORM, test runner, or linter at POC stage — kept deliberately lean.

## Key commands

> Commands honor `NODE_ENV` (`stage` default, or `prod`). Each environment uses its own DB file.

```bash
NODE_ENV=stage npm run migrate   # apply schema.sql
NODE_ENV=stage npm run seed      # seed user_id=1 + default categories
NODE_ENV=stage npm start         # boot the API
NODE_ENV=prod  npm start         # boot against the prod DB/config
```

## Architecture

- **Layered per module:** `route → controller → service → repository`. Controllers handle HTTP + boundary validation + money conversion; services hold business logic and invariants; repositories own SQL.
- **Money:** stored as integer **cents**; API speaks **decimals**. Convert at the controller boundary (`src/lib/money.js`).
- **Auth-ready:** `middleware/auth.js` injects `req.userId = 1` for now. Every table has `user_id`; swap this middleware for real auth in Phase 2 without touching queries.
- **Soft deletion:** every table has a nullable `deleted_at`. All reads filter `deleted_at IS NULL`; deletes set the timestamp. Soft-deleted resources return `404`.

### Vault / balance model (the core logic)

Vaults are logical allocations within one balance, not separate accounts.

- `total` (net worth) = `SUM(income) − SUM(expense)` — unaffected by vaults.
- `vault[V] balance` = `SUM(income WHERE vault_id = V)`.
- `available` (spendable) = `total − SUM(all vault balances)`.

Allocate = set an income's `vault_id`; withdraw = set it back to `NULL`. Each logs a row in `vault_history`. Expenses can never carry a `vault_id`.

## Key files

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `src/config/env.js` | Loads/validates `.env.<NODE_ENV>`; exports config. |
| `src/config/db.js` | `better-sqlite3` connection (path from config). |
| `src/db/schema.sql` | Full DDL (all tables, indexes, constraints). |
| `src/db/migrate.js` / `seed.js` | Apply schema / seed user + categories. |
| `src/middleware/` | `auth.js`, `errorHandler.js`, `validate.js`. |
| `src/lib/money.js` | Decimal ↔ cents conversion. |
| `src/modules/{transactions,vaults,categories,balance}/` | Feature modules (route/controller/service/repository). |
| `src/app.js` / `src/server.js` | Express wiring / boot sequence. |

## Workflow

Follow the global loop for non-trivial work:

1. `/prime` — load context (this file + `PRD.md`, git log, structure).
2. `/plan-feature <task>` — research first; plan saved to `.claude/agents/plans/`.
3. `/execute <plan-path>` — implement step by step, validate after each task.
4. `/commit` — atomic commit, conventional tag (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, …).

Per-project long-term memory lives in `~/.claude/projects/<path>/memory/`.

## Conventions

- Minimal changes — only what's asked; no unrequested refactors or comments.
- Validate at boundaries only (request bodies); trust internal guarantees.
- Positive amounts only; `type` carries the sign. Reject `expense` + `vault_id` with `400`.
